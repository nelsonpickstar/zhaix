Wikipedia (Listeni/ˌwɪkᵻˈpiːdiə/ or Listeni/ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə/ wik-i-pee-dee-ə) is a free online encyclopedia that allows its users to edit almost any article.[5] Wikipedia is the largest and most popular general reference work on the Internet[6][7][8] and is ranked among the ten most popular websites.[3] Wikipedia is owned by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation.[9][10][11]
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[12] Sanger[13] coined its name,[14] a portmanteau of wiki[notes 3] and encyclopedia. There was only the English language version initially, but it quickly developed similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing practices. With 5,272,804 articles, English Wikipedia is the largest out of more than 290 versions of encyclopedias on Wikipedia. Overall, Wikipedia consists of more than 40 million articles in more than 250 different languages[16] and as of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.[17]
In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia, and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached Encyclopædia Britannica's.[18] Criticism of Wikipedia includes claims that it exhibits systemic bias, presents a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods",[19] and that in controversial topics, it is subject to manipulation and spin.[20]

Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called Nupedia
Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were so successful.[21]
Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[12] Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were the Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of Richard Stallman.[22] Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia.[23][24] While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[25][26] Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[27] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "
